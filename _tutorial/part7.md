title: 'Part 7: Adapting Existing three.js Applications'
---
> Download [Argon4](http://argonjs.io/argon-app/) and the [Tutorial Source Code](https://github.com/argonjs/docs/tree/gh-pages/code). <br> This tutorial uses the *7-periodic* and *resources* directories.<br> **[Live Demo](/code/7-periodic)**

## Coming Soon ...

This part of the tutorial will use one of the existing [three.js examples](http://threejs.org/examples/), the [3D periodic table](http://threejs.org/examples/#css3d_periodictable) to demonstrate how an existing three.js application can be adapted for use with Argon.

The tutorial will explain what needs to be changed in a typical three.js example, and why.
